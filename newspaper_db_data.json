Over 50 tender documents posted in the past year revealed that at least 11 Chinese entities have sought access to restricted US technologies or cloud services. Four of these explicitly named Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud service provider, though accessed through Chinese intermediaries rather than directly from AWS.",

In doing so, he shocked his three bandmates.\r\n\r\nThe Beatles had symbolized the great communal spirit of the era. How could they possibly come apart?\r\n\r\nFew at the time were aware of the underlying fissures.

        "context": "Officials have unveiled the gold, silver and bronze medals that will be awarded at this summer’s Olympic games in Paris, and each one contains a unique souvenir: a fragment of scrap iron from the Eiffel Tower.\r\n\r\n“It’s the opportunity for the athletes to bring back a piece of Paris with them,” Thierry Reboul, creative director of Paris 2024, told reporters last week, per BBC News. “The absolute symbol of Paris and France is the Eiffel Tower.”\r\n\r\nDesigned by Gustave Eiffel, the Eiffel Tower opened in 1889 after roughly two years of construction. Since then, the landmark has undergone extensive renovations, “with some of the original iron cut off and preserved over time,” as Artnet’s Adam Schrader writes. Now, some of those preserved metal fragments have found new homes.\r\n\r\nEach new Olympic medal features a piece of Eiffel Tower iron—though the signature “Eiffel Tower brown” paint, which the structure has sported since 1968, has been removed. These pieces have been shaped into hexagons (the “geometric shape of France,” according to the games’ official website) and engraved with the words “Paris 2024,” the Olympic rings and the Games logo, “which looks like a flame or the face of a woman with a chic bob haircut,” as John Leicester of the Associated Press (AP) writes.",

        "context": "Rembrandt van Rijn was the definition of an “old master”—a painter so deft, his portraits seem to leap from the canvas. But how did he achieve his effects in a time long before projectors, computers and other 21st-century tools? The answer to that question could be boiled down to one word: science. As Steph Yin reports for The New York Times, new research suggests that Rembrandt may have relied on complex optics while he painted.\r\n\r\nIn a new paper published in the Journal of Optics, two independent researchers from the U.K. posit that Rembrandt used projections in his work. They demonstrate that Rembrandt could have used optical equipment like mirrors, camera obscuras and lenses to project images of his subjects onto papers and canvas. The images could then have been used to create technically accurate proportions and facial details, which were later etched or painted. The researchers didn’t just rely on contemporary accounts to piece together their theory; rather, they made calculations of things like head size and recreated projection setups that would have allowed the painter to achieve some of his most beautiful effects.",

They would become known as the Impressionists, and they painted scenes from everyday life using bright colors and visible brushstrokes.\r\n\r\nNow, an exhibition marking the 150th anniversary of that historic show has landed in Washington, D.C. First shown at Paris’ Musée d’Orsay and now on display at Washington’s National Gallery of Art, “Paris 1874: The Impressionist Moment” reunites many of the paintings first featured in the 1874 exhibition—including Monet’s Impression, Sunrise, which has never before been shown in the United States.\r\n\r\n“If there’s one painting that is the absolute icon of this moment and show, it’s Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise,” Kimberly Jones, curator of 19th-century French painting at the National Gallery of Art, tells Town & Country’s Adam Rathe. “It’s the painting that gave the movement its name.”",
